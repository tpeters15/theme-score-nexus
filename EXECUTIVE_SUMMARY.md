## üéØ What The Platform Does

### The Challenge
Investment analysts need to:
- Track regulatory changes across multiple jurisdictions
- Monitor market signals from dozens of sources
- Research companies against complex sustainability frameworks
- Deliver weekly intelligence memos to stakeholders

**Manual Process:**
```
Analyst reads 50+ articles/week ‚Üí Manual note-taking ‚Üí 
Excel spreadsheets ‚Üí Weekly report writing ‚Üí 40 hours/week
```

### The Solution
**Automated Intelligence Pipeline:**
```
Automated scrapers ‚Üí AI classification ‚Üí Structured database ‚Üí 
Instant queries ‚Üí Auto-generated insights ‚Üí 2 hours/week
```
